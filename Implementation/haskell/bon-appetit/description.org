Anna and Brian order items at a restaurant, but Anna declines to eat any of
the item (where ) due to an allergy. When the check comes, they decide to split
the cost of all the items they shared; however, Brian may have forgotten that
they didn't split the item and accidentally charged Anna for it.

You are given , , the cost of each of the items, and the total amount of money
that Brian charged Anna for her portion of the bill. If the bill is fairly
split, print Bon Appetit; otherwise, print the amount of money that Brian must
refund to Anna.
