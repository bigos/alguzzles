This is a set of multiple choice questions, provided entirely for your self-assessment, and is based on the the most fundamental aspects of data structure and algorithms. The level of the questions is no more than that of what one would encounter in an introductory Data Structures class.

Some of these data structures might be new to some of you. Do read about them and alongside, try to attempt the questions - treat it as an opportunity to learn something new!









Question 10.

(c) O(n2)
(d) O(n3)
(e) O(1)

Do not add any leading, trailing or intermediate spaces.
In case you are unsure about the answer, you can use the letter 'x'.
Your answer should contain ten lines, answering sequentially, all of the questions 1 to 10.
