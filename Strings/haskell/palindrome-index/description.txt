Given a string, , of lowercase letters, determine the index of the character whose removal will make a palindrome. If is already a palindrome or no such character exists, then print . There will always be a valid solution, and any correct answer is acceptable. For example, if "bcbc", we can either remove 'b' at index or 'c' at index .

Input Format

The first line contains an integer, T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each line i of the T subsequent lines (where 0 =< i < T) describes a test case in the form of a single string, Si.

Constraints

    All characters are lowercase English letters.

Output Format

Print an integer denoting the zero-indexed position of the character that makes not a palindrome; if is already a palindrome or no such character exists, print .

Sample Input

3
aaab
baa
aaa

Sample Output

3
0
-1

Explanation

Test Case 1: "aaab"
Removing 'b' at index results in a palindrome, so we print on a new line.

Test Case 2: "baa"
Removing 'b' at index results in a palindrome, so we print on a new line.

Test Case 3: "aaa"
This string is already a palindrome, so we print ; however, , , and are also all acceptable answers, as the string will still be a palindrome if any one of the characters at those indices are removed.
