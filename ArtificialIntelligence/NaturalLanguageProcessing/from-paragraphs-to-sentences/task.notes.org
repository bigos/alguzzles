between the letters and sounds. For our purpose the letter Y is particularly
tricky.

**** long vowels

seen

**** joined vowels

flying

*** consonants

| b | c | d | f | g | h | j | k | l | m | n | p | q | r | s | t | v | w | x | z |

*** letter Y

Letter 'y' sometimes is not a vowel as in 'yacht'.

| y |

*** silent letters

Some letters, notably E are sometimes not pronounced, as in 'are'.

| e |
