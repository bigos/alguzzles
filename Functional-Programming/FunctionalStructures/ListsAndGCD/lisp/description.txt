We call an integer p>1 a prime number (or simply a prime) if its only positive divisors are 1 and p.

Fundamental theorem of arithmetic states: Every positive integer n can be uniquely expressed as a product of power of primes, i.e.,

N=pn11×pn22×pn33×…

where,

    pi is the ith prime, i.e., p1=2,p2=3,p3=5,…
    ∀i.ni≥0

Greatest common divisor of two positive integers

For two positive integers, A and B, whose prime factorization is represented as

A=pa11×pa22×pa33×…

B=pb11×pb22×pb33×…

We calculate the greatest common divisor, gcd(A,B), as

gcd(A,B)=pmin(a1,b1)1×pmin(a2,b2)2×pmin(a3,b3)3×…

Greater common divisor of a list of numbers

Greatest common factor of a list of positive integers, lst={l1,l2,…lq}, is represented as

gcd(lst)=gcd(l1,gcd(l2,gcd(l3,…,(gcd(lq−1,lq))…)))

Finite representation of prime factorization

Since primes are infinite, it is not possible to store factors in the form provided above. To that end, we will only consider those prime factors (pi) whose power is greater than zero (ni>0). That is:

N=pni1i1×pni2i2×pni3i3×…

, where

    pij<pij+1
    0<nij,  j∈[1,2,…]; for rest ni=0

And we will represent them as following:

N=pi1 ni1 pi2 ni2 pi3 ni3 …

For example:

    49=72=7 2
    28=22×71=2 2 7 1

Challenge

You are given the elements of list, lst, in the representation provided above. Find its greatest common divisor, i.e., gcd(lst).

Input Format

First line contains an integer, q, which is the size of list, lst.
Then follows q lines, where ith line represents the factors of ith element of lst, li

Output Format

Print one line representing the greatest common divisor of lst (gcd(lst)) in the above representation.

Constraints

    2≤q≤1000
    All other integers lie in [1,105]
    1≤ Total number of prime factors of an element ≤100

Notes

    Test cases are designed such that gcd(lst) will always be greater than 1.

Sample Input #00

2
7 2
2 2 7 1

Sample Output #00

7 1

Sample Input #01

4
2 2 3 2 5 3
3 2 5 3 11 1
2 2 3 3 5 4 7 6 19 18
3 10 5 15

Sample Output #01

3 2 5 3

Explanation

Test case #00: lst={72,22×71}. Therefore gcd(lst)=71.
Test case #01: lst={22×32×53, 32×53×111, 22×33×54×76×1918,310×515}. gcd(lst)=32×53
