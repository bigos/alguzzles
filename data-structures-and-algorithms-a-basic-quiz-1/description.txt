This is a set of simple multiple choice questions, provided entirely for your self-assessment, and is based on the the most fundamental aspects of data structure and algorithms. The level of the questions is no more than that of what one would encounter in an introductory Programming and Data Structures class in the freshman year at college.












Answer Format

Replace the blanks (represented by three consecutive hyphens) with the appropriate letter ('a','b','c','d' or 'e') for each of the questions. Then, hit the submit button.

Do not add any leading, trailing or intermediate spaces.
In case you are unsure about the answer, you can use the letter 'x'.
Your answer should contain ten lines, answering sequentially, all of the questions 1 to 10.

For example: (Please note that these are NOT the correct answers and this example is meant only for the purpose of explaining the format)

1:a
2:b
3:c
4:d
5:e
6:a
7:b
8:x
9:d
10:a

Explanation

The candidate has concluded that the correct answer the Question 1 is option 'a', the correct answer to Question 2 is option 'b' and so on. He/she does not know the answer to Question 8, hence uses the character 'x'.

Scoring

Your score is proportional to the number of answers (indicated by the letter options) identified correctly by you.
