Problem Statement

For a given list with N integers, return a new list removing the elements at odd positions. The input and output portions will be handled automatically. You need to write a function with the recommended method signature.

Input Format
N integers contained in the list, each on a new line.

Output Format
List of integers, with integers at odd positions removed (so the first element, the third element and so on will be removed). The relative positions of the remaining (even-position) elements should be the same as they were in the original array. Each integer will be on a new line.
